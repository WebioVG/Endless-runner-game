# Endless-runner-game
This project is for me an introduction to Javascript game development. Its only goal is to let me have fun while learning.
If you ever find any bugs, please let me know.

# Installation
To be able to play the game, you should open the folder with VS Code and run the code with its LiveServer extension.
